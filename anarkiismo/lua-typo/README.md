Lua-typo
========

Description
-----------
This package tracks common typographic flaws in LuaLaTeX documents,
specially widows, orphans, hyphenated words split over two pages,
consecutive lines ending with hyphens, paragraphs ending on
too short lines, etc.

Documentation
-------------

For the impatient: have a look at files demo.tex and demo.pdf to see
a short example of how some flaws are highlighted.

Then read the documentation in English (file lua-typo.pdf) or in French
(file lua-typo-fr.pdf).

License
-------

Released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later
See http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
for the details of that license.

Installation
------------

This bundle is meant to be included in most TeX distributions,
but if you really need to install it by yourself
1. run "luatex lua-typo.dtx" to strip the comments and create
   lua-typo.sty, lua-typo.cfg, lua-typo.ltx and lua-typo-fr.ltx;
2. run "lualatex lua-typo.ltx" to get the full documentation
   (lua-typo.pdf) in English;
3. run "lualatex lua-typo-fr.ltx" to get the French documentation
   (lua-typo-fr.pdf, without documented code).

Recommended locations for installation:
- TDS:tex/lualatex/lua-typo/lua-typo.sty
- TDS:tex/lualatex/lua-typo/lua-typo.cfg
- TDS:doc/lualatex/lua-typo/lua-typo.pdf
- TDS:doc/lualatex/lua-typo/demo.pdf
- TDS:doc/lualatex/lua-typo/demo.tex
- TDS:doc/lualatex/lua-typo/README.md
- TDS:source/lualatex/lua-typo/lua-typo.dtx

On Debian based systems, the "TDS:" prefix can be replaced by "$HOME/texmf/"
for a single user installation.
